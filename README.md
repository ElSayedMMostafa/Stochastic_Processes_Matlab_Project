# Stochastic_Processes_Matlab_Project
This project is the course project of 'CIE 327 - Probability and Stochastic Processes' 
This course is offered in the 2nd year Communication and Information Engineering Program - Uinversity of Science and Technology, Zewail City, Egypt.

The project is about a Matlab application performs the following to any signals:
      (1) Statistical Average
      (2) Time Average
      (3) Statistical Auto-Correclation
      (4) Time Auto-Correlation
      (5) Get the period of the signal using the Auto-Correlation concept.
    
All the functions used is desinged by me according to what I learned during the course CIE 327.
